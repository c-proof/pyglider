# Installation

## conda/pip

PyGlider depends on `dask` and `netcdf4`, both of which can be tricky to install using ``pip``,
hence we recommend these be installed with [``conda``](https://www.anaconda.com/).  To install
PyGlider, create an environment, and do

```
conda create -n gliderwork
conda activate gliderwork
conda install -c conda-forge pyglider
```

## Editable installation

If you want to be able to edit the files in `pyglider/pyglider` then install
the dependencies as above.  Fork of PyGlider on github, and then clone it locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourname/pyglider.git
```

Navigate to the new ``pyglider`` directory and then do `pip install -e .`.
That will re-install pyglider with links to the local directory, so you
can edit the library files. If you do so,  consider making a pull-request
with your changes!
